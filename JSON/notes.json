        "My first note, if you're reading this then welcome this website, was made by me using many sources. Like most, I am a highly proficient stack overflow copy and paste but I would like to think I know my way around an IDE, and most languages pertaining to web design. One exception to this would be Java and JSON, although my current employer JWU has employed me to develop their IT student portal which has been very informative. An example of this would be using JSON and Java in conjunction to create a sort of database I am currently using this to hold my notes. Then I parse and format the data using Java populate the HTML and format it using CSS. Don't worry the school's database is not built this way I'm not absolutely insane. But it is a handy trick for when you don't want to set up an SQL database or can't do so. Anyway, that's all for now hopefully soon I'll have some more revelations to share.",
